🌐 LangChain & GenAI Series — Practical Projects Repo

Welcome to my end-to-end GenAI & LangChain learning hub.
This repository is a growing collection of real, practical, hands-on projects built while mastering the modern GenAI stack.

I’m building everything from scratch — small experiments, RAG workflows, agents, vector stores, API integrations, voice-enabled AI, and complete applications.

If you're exploring real-world AI engineering, this repo will feel like home.

🚀 Tech Stack Used
Category	Technologies
Language	Python
Frameworks	Flask
AI / LLM Tooling	LangChain, OpenAI, HuggingFace
Vector Databases	Chroma / FAISS (project-specific)
APIs & Models	OpenAI GPT series, HuggingFace models
🧩 What This Repo Contains

✔️ Practical LangChain beginner → advanced projects

✔️ RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementations

✔️ Vector store demos (Chroma, FAISS, etc.)

✔️ Chains, tools, memory, agents

✔️ Flask-based AI apps

✔️ OpenAI & HuggingFace model integrations

✔️ Utility scripts to learn concepts with clarity

✔️ Real-world workflows like Q/A bots, PDF chat, embeddings, structured output, and more

This repo grows as I grow — each project represents one step ahead in my GenAI engineer journey.


✨ Why I Created This Repo

Because I don’t want to “learn theory.”
I want to build.
This repo is my personal space to:

understand how real GenAI works

create deployable apps

use LangChain like a production-ready toolkit

build confidence for freelancing, hackathons, and placements

If you’re learning LangChain or GenAI the practical way — you’ll find huge value here.

🤝 Contributions

This repo is mainly for my learning journey, but if you want to contribute ideas or improvements, feel free to open an issue.
